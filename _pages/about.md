안녕하세요! I'm Junho Mun, a student pursuing dual degrees in Food Science & Biotechnology and Computer Science & Engineering at Kyungpook National University.

My research interests lie at the intersection of bioinformatics, computational biology, and machine learning. I am currently working as a research intern at the Computational Biology & Bioinformatics Lab, where I focus on developing predictive models for healthcare applications.

I am passionate about applying computational methods and data science techniques to solve biological and medical problems. Through this website, I share my learning journey, research experiences, and projects in bioinformatics and data science.
